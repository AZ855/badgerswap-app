# BadgerSwap — Marketplace Mobile App

A team-based marketplace mobile application developed over a semester-long project.  
This repository highlights collaborative software engineering, mobile app architecture, and end-to-end product implementation.

## What this project is
BadgerSwap is a marketplace-style app where users can browse listings and interact with other users through core marketplace flows (e.g., creating items, viewing item details, managing user state, etc.). The focus of this project was to build a maintainable and testable mobile application with clear separation of concerns.

## Engineering focus (what I want reviewers to notice)
- **Team-based development**: collaborative planning, code reviews, and feature integration across multiple contributors.
- **Modular UI & navigation**: reusable components and consistent screen structure.
- **Data flow & state**: predictable data handling across screens and features.
- **Reliability practices**: validation, error handling, and basic testing discipline where applicable.
- **Documentation**: clear setup instructions and implementation notes for future contributors.

## My contribution (Chenchen / Amily)
I contributed to core parts of the application implementation and integration in a team setting, including:
- Implementing and refining key screens/components and their navigation flow
- Improving data handling and user interactions across features
- Supporting integration work (merging, resolving conflicts, ensuring the app runs end-to-end)
- Writing/maintaining documentation for reproducibility

## Tech stack
- React Native / Expo
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- (Add: Firebase/Firestore/Auth if used)
- (Add: Expo Router / React Navigation if used)

## How to run locally
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Expo Go app (for quick testing) or an emulator (iOS/Android)

### Install
```bash
npm install
```

## Start
bash
```
npx expo start
```
Then scan the QR code using Expo Go (same Wi-Fi) or run on an emulator.

## Repository notes
If this project uses cloud services (e.g., Firebase), configuration files containing secrets are intentionally excluded.

If you need environment variables, create a .env file based on .env.example (if provided).

## Project status
This repository is maintained as a portfolio/demo artifact and may not reflect active development.
